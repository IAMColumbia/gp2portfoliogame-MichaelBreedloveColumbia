# Clipart Carnage

## Short Description
Fight off waves of deadly clipart enemies.
## Long Description
Clipart Carnage is a twin-stick shooter with an emphasis on experimentation, speed, and a bizarre artstyle centered around clipart and bad stock photos. In Clipart Carnage, the player controls a simple yellow smiley face, and must use their arsenal to fend off waves of progressively stronger opponents as they climb to the top of the Corporate Colosseum for riches. This isn't just any arsenal, though - all of your weapons are enchanted with the ability to fire any type of ammunition you can find; want an SMG that fires rockets? Sure. A rocket launcher that fires nine millimeter? Not sure why you would want that, but go right ahead. As long as you have the ammunition available, the world is your oyster.
## Why try to win?
Every time you defeat the boss of a floor or successfully reach the top of the Corporate Colosseum, you are rewarded with a permanent in-game currency which can be spent to unlock more weapons and ammunition which can be found in the Colosseum, allowing the player to experiment even more. The Colosseum itself is also riddled with secrets for the player to discover.

## Genre
Clipart Carnage is a Twin-Stick Shooter Rogue-Lite.
